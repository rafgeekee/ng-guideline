# Angular Guideline

## Purpose
The purpose of this is to set provide a rough guide for JavaScript and Angular syntax, conventions, and structuring. To support the building of the Angular Applications. The main ideology is to set a style of coding that provides a capable foundation to improve maintainability, readability and performant code.

## Credit and amendments
Never work in a vacuum. If you find any other resource or have any questions about any of this guide; please speak up - so we can improve the guidelines and maintain a robust codebase.

This guide is based on https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide, it has been reduced to the core aspects to the structure of the project and its files. For more information on parts of the guide please read the original guideline as its more comprehensive. The original guideline also provides information on further best practices for development with angular. Such as Automation and generators.

## Style codes
* *[Style [Y{number}](./#style-y001)]*: are from the original [Angular Guidelines](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide). Some of these styles may be briefer than original or modified to incorporate our own information.
* *[Style [S-[CODE]{number}](./js-guidelines.md#s-js001)]*: are Styles formatted by Sainsbury's, based on our time spent with angular. Each section has their own code for easier navigation if they have extra styles differing from the original guide.

## Notes
This guideline is not absolute. It should be used as a means of a tool and a guide to help build better applications, there may be instances where some Styles do not fit into the format of a project.

This guideline is still in development. It will be improved upon over time, as we learn and discover the force.
