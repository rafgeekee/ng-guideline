# Angular Guideline

## Purpose
The purpose of this is to provide a rough guide for JavaScript and Angular syntax, conventions, and structuring to support the building of the AngularJS applications. The main ideology is to set a style of coding that provides a good foundation to improve maintainability, readability, and performant code.

## Credit and amendments
Never work in a vacuum. If you find any other resource or have any questions about any of this guide; please speak up - so we can improve the guidelines and maintain a robust codebase.

This guide's foundation is [angular-styleguide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide), it has been reduced to the core aspects to the structure of the project and its files. The original guidelines are more comprehensive with the addition of best practices for development with AngularJS.

## Style Codes
* *[Style [Y{number}](./#style-y001)]*: are from the original [Angular Guidelines](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide). Some of these styles may be briefer than original or modified to incorporate our information.
* *[Style [S-[CODE]{number}](./js-guidelines.md#s-js001)]*: are Styles formatted by Sainsbury's, based on our time spent with angular. Each section has their code for easier navigation if they have extra styles differing from the original guide.

## Notes
This guideline is not absolute. It is simply a guide to help build better applications; there may be instances where some styles do not fit into your project.

This guideline is ever evolving. We are learning and adapting these guidelines as the shortcomings become apparent. May the force be with you.
